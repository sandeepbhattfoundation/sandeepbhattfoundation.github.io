Sandeep Bhat Foundation — Static Website (GitHub Pages)

This zip contains a ready-to-publish static site with these pages:
- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About)
- projects.html (Projects)
- work.html (Our Work)
- contact.html (Contact)
- donation.html (Donation)
- assets/ (styles.css, script.js, favicon.png)

Publish with GitHub Pages (no domain required yet):
1) Go to https://github.com and create a public repo named YOURUSERNAME.github.io
2) Upload all files/folders from this zip into the repo root (not inside a subfolder).
3) In the repo, open Settings → Pages.
4) Under "Build and deployment," set Source to "Deploy from a branch", and Branch to "main" (or your default branch), then Save.
5) Wait ~1 minute, then visit https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io

Optional: Add your custom domain later:
1) In the same Settings → Pages, add your domain (e.g., example.org) under "Custom domain".
2) At your domain registrar, create a CNAME record for your root or "www" that points to YOURUSERNAME.github.io
3) Wait for DNS to propagate; GitHub will issue HTTPS automatically.

Editing content:
- Update text directly inside the HTML files with any code editor.
- Tweak colors/spacing in assets/styles.css
- The contact form currently uses mailto: contact@example.org (no backend). You can change it later to a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms.
- The donation page contains placeholder buttons; replace their href with your payment links (PayPal Donate, Stripe Checkout, Razorpay, etc.).

Support:
- If your Pages URL returns 404 at first, wait 1–2 minutes and refresh.
- Ensure files are in the repo root (index.html should be at the top level).
